# Developer Guide

## Design

#### Ui Component

The structure of the Ui Component is illustrated in the following diagram:

![UiComponentDiagram](images/UiComponent.png)

API : `Ui.java`

1. The `Ui` class is used to communicate with users.
2. The `Ui` class depends on `Scanner` to get inputs from users.
3. The `Main` class uses `Ui#getNextLine()` to receive `commands` from users.
4. And `FlashcardFactory` and `GroupFactory` classes uses methods in `Ui` class to complete 
the execution of various commands.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions between the `Ui` and `FlashcardFactory` components to complete the
execution of an example command (`deleteCommand`).

![UiSequenceDiagram](images/UiSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Parser Component

The structure of the Parser Component is illustrated in the following diagram:

![ParserComponentDiagram](images/ParserComponent.png)

API : `Parser.java`

1. The `Main` class (not shown in the diagram above) uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. The `Parser` class depends on multiple classes including the `FlashcardFactory`, `FlashcardList`, `GroupFactory
`, `GroupList`, `StudyPlanList` and `Ui` classes to create a `Command` object from user input.
3. The resulting `Command` object which then can be executed by the `Main` class.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions between the `Parser` and `Command` components for the
`parseCommand` API call from `Main` class. We use the interaction between the `Parser` and `DeleteCommand` class as an example: 

<img src="images/ParserAndCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="ParserAndCommandSequenceDiagram" width="500"/>

#### Storage Component

The structure of the Storage component is illustrated in the folowing diagram.

![StorageComponentDiagram](images/Storage_UML.png)

The `Storage` class can be used to save, delete and load classes that implement the `Savable` interface.  
`Storage` is implemented using the Singleton pattern because there only should be one instance in the program at any given time.  
`Storage` used the Gson library to serialize/deserialize objects to/from JSON strings.  
  
The `ModifyinCommand` class uses the `Storage` class to save/delete objects when a change is made.  
The `Main` class uses the `Storage` object to load objects at the start of exectuion.


## Implementation

#### Set Priority Feature - Proposed Implementation

The Set Priority feature allows users to mark a flashcard with a specified priority level. The priority level is
then reflected when the user requests a list of existing flashcards.

`PriorityLevel` is stored as an enum with four fields: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH and DEFAULT.

The feature implements the following operations:

- `Flashcard#setPriorityLevel()` - Sets a flashcard to a specified priority level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH).
- `Flashcard#getPriorityAsString()` - Return an icon indicating the flashcard's priority level.

The following class diagram shows the structures relevant to the Set Priority feature:

![SetPriorityFeatureClassDiagram](images/SetPriorityFeatureClassDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the set priority mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and creates a new `Flashcard` (of type Event, Person, or Other), 
with a default priority level of DEFAULT.

Step 2. The user executes `priority [flashcard index] [priority level]` command and the `setPriorityLevel` 
operation is invoked. Subsequently, the flashcard of specified index is retrieved from the main `FlashcardList` 
instance. Its priority level is set to the specified priority.

The following sequence diagram shows the relevant interactions behind `setPriorityLevel`:

![setPriorityLevelSequenceDiagram](images/setPriorityLevelSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Study Plan Feature - Proposed Implementation

The Study Plan feature is facilitated by `StudyPlanList`.

Internally, it implements a `TreeMap`, with date as key and the list of flashcard indexes to study as value. 
Key-value pairs in the `TreeMap` are sorted by dates.

It implements the following operations:

- `StudyPlanList#updateStudyPlan()` - Updates the study plan list.
- `StudyPlanList#deleteStudyPlan()` - Deletes a study plan from the study plan list.
- `StudyPlanList#getStudyPlanList()` - Gets the list of study plans.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the study plan mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and an empty `StudyPlanList` is initialized.

Step 2. The user executes `plan` command and the `updateStudyPlan` operation is invoked. The application prompts the
user for date and the corresponding list of flashcards indexes.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `updateStudyPlan` operation works:

![updateStudyPlanSequenceDiagram](images/updateStudyPlanSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 3. The user executes `delete-plan` command and the `deleteStudyPlan` operation is invoked. The application
prompts the user for the date for which the study plan is to be deleted.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `deleteStudyPlan` operation works:

![deleteStudyPlanSequenceDiagram](images/deleteStudyPlanSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 4. The user executes `show-plan` command and the `getStudyPlanList` operation is invoked. The application
displays the user's study plan list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `getStudyPlanList` operation works:

![getStudyPlanListSequenceDiagram](images/getStudyPlanListSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Random Review Feature - Proposed Implementation

The random review mechanism is facilitated by `FlashcardList`.It stores an `List<Flashcard>` internally which contains
all the flashcards created by the user.

It implements the following operation:

- `FlashcardList#reviewRandomFlashcards()` -Randomize all the flashcards, then display the details of them one by one 
to the user. And update the review status of the flashcards corresponding to the user's' responses.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the random review mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `FlashcardsList` will be initialized with the empty 
flashcards list.

Step 2. The user executes `event/person/other commands` to add multiple flashcards to the flashcard list 
(The detailed implementation of creating flashcards explained in the Flashcard Creation Feature)

Step 3. The user executes `random command` and `reviewRandomFlashcards()` operation is invoked. The application prompts 
responses for each unreviewed flashcard that whether the user want to mark it as reviewed or not.

The following sequence diagram shows how the   `reviewRandomFlashcards()` operation works:

## Appendix A: Product Scope
### Target user profile

History Flashcard (HF) is for those who are studying history subjects to create flashcards which summarize 
the most important information for historical events, figures and artifacts. HF is optimized for those who 
prefer to use a simple Command Line Interface (CLI). 

### Value proposition

History is a subject that usually relies on heavy memorisation of a large amount of content. In order to 
make revision easier for history students, HF includes features that help with memory retention and organises 
information in a way that makes it convenient to review.

In HF, information can be entered in the form of flashcards with different fields, such as the name of the 
historical event/person, the relevant dates, and a summary. Flashcards can be categorised into user-defined groups
 to enable students to organise their knowledge better. Users can also create daily study plans.
 
In addition, the user can shuffle and display random flashcards for revision.
