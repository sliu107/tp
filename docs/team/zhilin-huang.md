PROJECT: History Flashcard

#### Overview

History Flashcard (HF) is an app for history students to create flashcards which summarize the most important
information for historical events, figures and artifacts. 
HF is optimized for those who prefer to use a simple Command Line Interface (CLI), and includes features that help
with memory retention and make information convenient to review.

#### Summary of Contributions

- **Code Contributed**: [Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&search=zhilin-huang) to
 my code on tP Code Dashboard
- **Enhancements implemented**:
    1. Feature: List all flashcards
        - What it does: Allows users to input `list` to list all flashcards in the application.
        - Justification: This feature is needed for users to review all flashcards currently in the application.
        - Highlights: In the [pull request](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-1/tp/pull/21) to implement this
        enhancement, I added the `Parser` class and the `Command` for all commands to inherit from and this roughly
        determines the structure of the code base. The `FlashcardList` class was implemented to handle all flashcards
        in the application.
    2. Feature: Delete a flashcard
        - What it does: Allows users to input `delete INDEX` to delete a flashcard.
        - Justification: This feature is needed for users to remove a flashcard that they no longer need.
        - Highlights: This feature was implemented in the same 
        [pull request](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-1/tp/pull/21) as the 'List all flashcards'
        feature and deletion of the flashcards is handled by the `FlashcardList` class.
    3. Feature: Update study plan
        - What it does: Allows users to input `plan` and then prompt users to input the date for the plan and indexes of
        existing flashcards planned to study on that day.
        - Justification: This feature is needed for users to set their study plans for the flashcards so that they
        can better manage their studies.
        - Highlights: In the [pull request](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-1/tp/pull/94) to implement this
        enhancement, I added the `StudyPlanList` class to handle all study plans in the application. Study plans
        are stored in a `TreeMap` with the date as key so that all entries are sorted by date.
    4. Feature: Display study plan
        - What it does: Allows users to input `show-plan` to display all study plans.
        - Justification: This feature is needed for users to view all the study plans they've added to the application.
        - Highlights: This feature was implemented in the same 
        [pull request](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-1/tp/pull/94) as the 'Update study plan' feature and
        the list of all study plans is retrieved from the `StudyPlanList` class.
    5. Feature: Delete study plan
        - What it does: Allows users to input `delete-plan` to delete a study plan for the study plan list.
        - Justification: This feature is needed for users to delete a study plan that they no longer need.
        - Highlights: In the [pull request](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-1/tp/pull/173) to implement this
         enhancement, I added a method in the `StudyPlanList` class to handle the deletion of study plans.
    6. Feature: Save and load study plans
        - What it does: Automatically saves study plans into storage and reloads study plans from storage when
         application restarts.
        - Justification: This feature is needed to keep users' study plans across multiple runs of the application.
        - Highlights: In the [pull request](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-1/tp/pull/191) to implement this
         feature, I modified the save and reload of `FlashcardList` to retain the order of flashcards so that the
         index of flashcards stored in `StudyPlanList` are still valid upon reload.
    7. Feature: List all reviewed flashcards
        - What is does: Allows users to input `list-reviewed` to view all reviewed flashcards in the application.
        - Justification: This feature is needed for users to keep track of what flashcards have been reviewed.

        enhancement, a method was added to the `FlashcardList` class to get all reviewed flashcards from the
        flashcard list. The index of each flashcard in the flashcard list is also printed out for the users.
    8. Feature: Search for all flashcards with names containing a specific keyword
        - What is done: Allows users to input `find KEYWORD` to display all flashcards with names containing the KEYWORD.
        - Justification: This feature is needed for users to conveniently search for flashcards when they cannot
        remember the index of the flashcard(s) they are looking for.
        - Highlights: This feature was implemented in the same 
        [pull request](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-1/tp/pull/95) as the 'List all reviewed flashcards' 
        feature. A method was added to the `FlashcardList` class to get all flashcards with names containing the
        specified keyword from the flashcard list. The index of each flashcard in the flashcard list is also printed
        out for the users.

## Contributions to the User Guide (Extracts)

An example of my contribution (study plans section) to the User Guide is extracted as follows:

### 3.7. Study Plans

Note that flashcards are identified by their index in study plans, so changing the index of flashcards could change
the flashcards associated with the study plans.

#### 3.7.1. Creating a New Study Plan: `plan`

Creates a new study plan by specifying date and indexes of existing flashcards.

Format: `plan`

The application will then prompt the user to enter the following fields:

- `DATE`: the date which the user want to set a study plan for
- `FLASHCARD_INDEXES`: indexes of the flashcards in the study plan

Example of usage:

```
plan
01/01/2020
1 3
```

#### 3.7.2. Displaying All Study Plans: `show-plan`

Lists all study plans.

Format: `show-plan`

#### 3.7.3. Deleting a Study Plan: `delete-plan`

Deletes a specified study plan. 
The user will be prompted to enter the date of the study plan they wish to delete.

Format: `delete-plan`

The application will then prompt the user to enter the following fields:

- `DATE`: the date which the user want to delete study plan

Example of usage:

```
delete-plan
01-01-2020
```

Another example of my contribution (FAQ) to the User Guide is extracted as follows:

## 4. FAQ

**Q**: How are the flashcards, flashcard groups, and study plans saved?

**A**: The application automatically saves these information in `JSON` format for you as you make changes to them. 
There is not a specific command to save these information to storage.

**Q**: Where are the flashcards, flashcard groups, and study plans saved?

**A**: They are saved under the `historyflashcards/` folder.

**Q**: Can I edit the storage files under the `historyflashcards/` folder?

**A**: Please avoid editing the files as changing the file format might cause the application to fail on reloads and
certain commands when you restart.

## Contributions to the Developer Guide (Extracts)

An example of my contribution (Study Plan Feature - Proposed Implementation) to the Developer Guide is extracted as
follows:

#### Study Plan Feature - Proposed Implementation

The Study Plan feature is facilitated by `StudyPlanList`.

Internally, it implements a `TreeMap`, with date as key and the list of flashcard indexes to study as value. 
Key-value pairs in the `TreeMap` are sorted by dates.

It implements the following operations:

- `StudyPlanList#updateStudyPlan()` - Updates the study plan list.
- `StudyPlanList#deleteStudyPlan()` - Deletes a study plan from the study plan list.
- `StudyPlanList#getStudyPlanList()` - Gets the list of study plans.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the study plan mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and an empty `StudyPlanList` is initialized.

Step 2. The user executes `plan` command and the `updateStudyPlan` operation is invoked. The application prompts the
user for date and the corresponding list of flashcards indexes.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `updateStudyPlan` operation works:

![updateStudyPlanSequenceDiagram](../images/updateStudyPlanSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 3. The user executes `delete-plan` command and the `deleteStudyPlan` operation is invoked. The application
prompts the user for the date for which the study plan is to be deleted.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `deleteStudyPlan` operation works:

![deleteStudyPlanSequenceDiagram](../images/deleteStudyPlanSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 4. The user executes `show-plan` command and the `getStudyPlanList` operation is invoked. The application
displays the user's study plan list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `getStudyPlanList` operation works:

![getStudyPlanListSequenceDiagram](../images/getStudyPlanListSequenceDiagram.png)

Another example of my contribution (Appendix E: Instructions for Manual Testing) to the Developer Guide is extracted as
follows:
